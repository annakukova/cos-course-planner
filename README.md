# cos-course-planner
A software product that helps you plan your schedule for the Computer Science major to graduate with no worries.

## Project description

A console application in Java, which already has information about the required COS courses offered at The American University in Bulgaria. The user will input their standing and the courses they have already taken. The program will make a schedule for the remaining semesters based on which courses have prerequisite courses. The program will take into account the max number of courses that can be taken per semester. Additionally, if there is not a suitable way to take all remaining courses from the major by the desired graduation time, the application will let the user know they cannot graduate with the COS major.
